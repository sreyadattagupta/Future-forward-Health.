# App description
Revolutionize your health care experience in Government Hospitals with our state-of-the-art website, redefining how you interact with health-care. Our platform seamlessly integrates essential features to ensure a smooth and efficient journey for both patients and health-care providers.

The journey begins with the homepage, a comprehensive resource offering fundamental insights into health care basics. Empowering users with knowledge, it serves as the gateway to a more informed and engaged community.

Navigating through the website, users can access a dedicated section featuring the real-time schedule of doctors. A groundbreaking addition to this is the implementation of a fingerprint sensor and face detection based attendance system. This innovative technology not only tracks the doctors' presence accurately but also updates the website in real-time. Patients can now confidently check the availability of their preferred health-care professional before planning their visit.

The appointment booking system takes user convenience to the next level. Seamlessly integrated into the website, it allows patients to schedule their visits with just a few clicks. The efficiency doesn't stop there – our system sends personalized WhatsApp reminders five minutes before the scheduled appointment, ensuring patients are punctual and well-prepared for their consultations.
Furthermore, our commitment to patient engagement extends to a dedicated feedback page. Your experiences matter, and we value your input in shaping the future of our healthcare services. Share your thoughts, suggestions, and experiences, contributing to an environment of continuous improvement.

# About
Solving real-life problems is not easy, but at the same time, it's not impossible. Keeping this in mind, a team of four student developers from  worked throughout February to solve a concerning problem by leveraging tech.

Our app primarily deals with the health sector. When it comes to saving a life, every millisecond counts!Sometimes, after booking an appointment with the doctor, we might arrive late for our visit because if we step out of the waiting area, we don't receive notifications about our serial number approaching. This can lead to someone else taking our place in the queue, even though it's our turn.. that's why we're here to change to that. We're MedSev!
