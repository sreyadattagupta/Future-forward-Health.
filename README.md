# About
Solving real-life problems is not easy, but at the same time, it's not impossible. Keeping this in mind, a team of four student developers from  worked throughout February to solve a concerning problem by leveraging tech.

Our app primarily deals with the health sector. When it comes to saving a life, every millisecond counts!Sometimes, after booking an appointment with the doctor, we might arrive late for our visit because if we step out of the waiting area, we don't receive notifications about our serial number approaching. This can lead to someone else taking our place in the queue, even though it's our turn.. that's why we're here to change to that. We're MedSev!
